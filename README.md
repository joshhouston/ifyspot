A cool spotify player (WIP)

Color Spot (formerly known as ifyspot) is a spotify web application that colors the application based on the colors of the album artwork that you are currently listening too.


A couple examples of the application when the song is in the paused state

The "Box" displays the users recent tracks, the artist, the album artwork, and song name
